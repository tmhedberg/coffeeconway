It's [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), which is not really a game at all, but a famous cellular automaton with some interesting emergent properties! Fun!

To build, install [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and run `coffee -c conway.coffee`. This will generate `conway.js`.

Then open up `conway.html` in your browser and start playing with gliders and stuff. In case it's not obvious, you can click on the grid cells to manually toggle them on and off.
